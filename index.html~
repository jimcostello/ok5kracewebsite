<p>This year's One-Mile Kids Race was held <a href="volney.html"><b>in memory of Chris Volney</b></a>, a tireless volunteer and dedicated coach who started the Glencadia Bullets Track Club for youth and was an inspiration and ardent supporter of the OK5k and OK1Run.

<li>The Ichabod Crane High School Art Club hosted an <strong>"Empty Bowls"</strong> supper on Tuesday, February 7 from 4:30-6:30 pm in the ICHS cafeteria. The public was invited to enjoy a delicious simple meal at this community event and take home a ceramic bowl made by Ichabod Crane students. The bowl serves as a visible reminder that people go to bed hungry every night. <br /><br />Admission by cash donation included handmade bowl, soup, bread, and beverage. The ceramic bowls were created by members of the Art Club and students in Ceramics classes at ICHS.   All proceeds from this "Empty Bowls" supper benefit the Valatie Ecumenical Food Pantry.<br /><br /> The Ichabod Crane High School Art Club makes the awards and poster for the <strong>OK5k</strong>.  In turn, the <strong>OK5k</strong> donates funds to them that they use to buy the supplies they need to make the soup bowls for "Empty Bowls." This is the fourth year of this cooperative, community event.<br /><br /> </li>
